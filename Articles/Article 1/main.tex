\section{Introduction}

\section{Background}

\add{
	- method was inspired by Khatib APF (however, it evolved into a different method) \\
	- different existing APF manipulator implementation articles \\
	- VFH \\
}

\section{Methodology}

\add{
	- optimization algorithm \\
	- robot kinematics (include the exact-reduced method) \\
	- primary task of distance goal \\
	- secondary task of repulsive field \\
	- task slowdown option \\
	- secondary task of manipulation measure \\
	- attractive field calculation (normalization of attractive force) \\
	- repulsive field calculation - matrix "convolution" method \\
	- matrix size and shape selection \\
	- PLOT: (ERK) kernel graphics \\
	- PLOT: (ERK) linear kernel graphics \\
	- PLOT: kernel field shape 	\\
	- interpolation of the repulsive field \\
}


\section{Implementation}

\section{Results}

\add{
	- include execution times \\
	- PLOT: kernel on robot graphics \\
}

\section{Discussion}

\add{
	- add the limitations of such method \\
	- the limitations of local search \\
	- number of parameters that need to be tuned (are there actually that many?)
}

\section{Conclusion}
