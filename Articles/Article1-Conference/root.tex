\section{INTRODUCTION}

\subsection{Motion Planning}

% PREDSTAVITEV REDUNDANCE

Kinematic redundancy~\cite{siciliano1990kinematic, siciliano2016springer} enables a manipulator to follow a predefined task space trajectory using the endeffector (EE), while simultaneously, optimising for an additional task with the remaining movement capacity without impacting the trajectory adherence. This is possible because the robot's degrees of freedom (DOF) go beyond what is required to perform the primary task. Consequently, the robot can adopt different joint configurations optimised according to the secondary task while performing the primary task. Common secondary tasks~\cite{siciliano2010robot} include avoiding singularities, optimising the manipulability measure, minimising joint torques and avoiding obstacles in the operating space.

% PREDSTAVITEV PRISTOPOV PLANIRANJA POTI V ROBOTIKI
The task of finding the joint trajectories of a manipulator is called motion planning~\cite{IDEASLab2023}. It consists of finding a sequence of joint configurations for a robot so that the robot can move along this path from its initial configuration to the goal configuration without colliding with itself, static obstacles or other agents in the environment. In addition to collision avoidance, motion planning for manipulators can optionally take into account various constraints, such as position, velocity, acceleration or jerk constraints for the joint angle or end effector, precision of the end effector with respect to position and orientation, stability of the manipulator, avoidance of singularities, or any number of other criteria.

There are numerous methods for planning manipulator movements~\cite{c51, c52}, they can rougly be seperated into global and local approaches. Global, sampling-based, methods such as PRM~\cite{vsvestka1997motion}, RRT*~\cite{lavalle1998rapidly, karaman2010incremental}, RRT-Connect~\cite{kuffner2000rrt}, Informerd RRT*~\cite{gammell2014informed}, BIT*~\cite{gammell2015batch} and others offer a globally optimal solution based on a global search in configuration space. However, the generated trajectories are not always smooth or optimal, and the performance of the methods may be insufficient for real-time operation.

%Global planning methods are typically more comprehensive, aiming to find a globally optimal trajectory for the manipulator. These methods often involve mapping out the entire path before movement begins, taking into account the known environment, which usually includes static obstacles. However, the downside of global planning methods is their computational intensity, which often renders them too slow for real-time applications. This limitation is particularly pronounced in dynamic or unpredictable environments where conditions change rapidly and require quick responses. Examples of global planning methods include graph-based algorithms like A* and Dijkstra's algorithm, which are known for their effectiveness in pathfinding but also for their computational demands [(Lavalle, 2006)].

%Sampling-based methods such as PRM, RRT, RRT*, RRT-Connect, Informerd RRT*, BIT* and others offer a solution based on a global search in configuration space. However, the generated trajectories are not always smooth or optimal, and the performance of the methods may be insufficient for real-time operation. 

\remove{Recently, a number of learning-based methods using data-driven techniques have been proposed to improve or accelerate the functionality of sampling-based methods. }

\remove{Trajectory optimisation methods such as CHOMP, STOMP and TrajOpt, on the other hand, use optimization to improve an initial seed trajectory. Consequently, the optimality of the solution is highly dependent on this initial trajectory. Nevertheless, these methods are capable of generating smooth trajectories, and although they can be too computationally intensive for high DOF dynamic real-time environments, they are generally effective in finding constrained motion plans. }

Local motion planning approaches employ optimization techniques, two common ones are inverse kinematics~\cite{c29,c38}, that is based on finding a least squares solution of the manipulator joint velocities, and quadratic programming (QP)~\cite{c21,c22,c23}.  Both methods are fast, suitable for real-time applications in dynamic environments and provide smooth solutions. However, since they do not plan further than one step ahead, they tend to get stuck in local minima. Therefore, they are often combined with a higher-level planner, for global static environment based \replace{motion}{path} planning, while local optimisation takes dynamic environment changes into account. In the following text we will focus on inverse kinematics based approaches.

\subsection{Kinematic Obstacle Avoidance}

Acceleration-based control excels in precise handling of motion changes, velocity-based control offers consistent and smooth movement, while force and torque-based control provides direct control over joint forces for robust physical interactions.

%In our work we use velocity control strategy for obstacle avoidance using the manipulator. naša primarna naloga premik vrha robota - end efektorja (EE) v želeno pozo, to je točko in orientacijo v prostoru naloge. Naša sekundarna naloga se tako izvaja v preostalem prostoru gibanja sklepov redundance robota (DOF, DOR). ??? je predlagal razširitev jakobijeve matrike end-efektorja z dodatno matriko transformacije izogibne hitrosti iz kartzezičnega prostora v prostor sklepov. Če nalogi nista popolnoma neodvisni ena od druge, in njune sklepne hitrosti niso medsebojno ortagonalne, lahko to pripelje do medsebojnega oviranja izbajanja nalog. Zato je ??? predlagal uporabo transformacijo hitrosti sekundarne naloge v  ničelnega prostora hitrosti primarne nalgoe, to je v prostor ortagonalnih hitrosti. Posledično izvajanje sekundarne naloge ne vpliva neposredno v izvajanje primarne naloge, gledano le v enem trenutku izvajanja.

%Colbaugh in Glass  1989 \cite{c31, c32} sta se problema lotila v dveh korakih. V prvem koraku sta izračunala trajektorijo vrha robota, v drugem pa sta uporabila optimizacijo za izboljšanje dinamičnega odziva robota med izvajanjem trajektorije in za druge naloge, kot so izogibanje ovir.

Various researchers have adopted different approaches to kinematic avoidance, as detailed in~\cite{c30, c39}.

Colbaugh and Glass (1989)~\cite{c31, c32} tackled this problem in a two-step process. Initially, they calculated the robot's end-effector trajectory. Subsequently, they used optimization to enhance the robot's dynamic response during trajectory execution and for tasks like obstacle avoidance.

Sciavicco and Siciliano~\cite{c34, c35}, as well as Egeland~\cite{c36}, independently introduced the concept of task-space augmentation, later revisited by Searji~\cite{c37}. This method involves extending the primary task Jacobian with the secondary task Jacobian into a square matrix, yielding a singular solution.

Maciejewski and Klein (1985)~\cite{c29}, and Nakamura and Hanafusa (1987)~\cite{c38}, presented the concept of task prioritization and a null space for avoidance. In this framework, the secondary task is restricted to velocities that do not directly affect the primary task's movement. Their method calculates avoidance joint velocities based on the minimum distance between a point on the manipulator and an avoidance point, object, or obstacle. Žlajpah~\cite{c41} improved the concept by proposing a reduced operational space formulation, that reshapes the Jacobain of the avoidance task from three cartesian axis to only the direction of obstacle avoidance. Petrič~\cite{c42} suggested a way to smoothly transition between avoidance and trajectory following tasks.

\subsection{Artificial Potential Field}

These approaches typically do not focus on the environmental context, often representing it as geometric primitives and then calculating the distance between these primitives and the lines describing the manipulator.

Khatib~\cite{c33} proposes the concept of an Artificial Potential Field. This field consists of a repulsive component that deflects the end effector away from obstacles, depicted as geometric primitives, and an attractive component that draws the manipulator towards its target. In the following years many different modifications and improvement of the original APF idea have been proposed, often focused on removal of local minimas in the potential field. Khim and Khosla~\cite{c40} suggested the use of harmonic functions to solve the problem of local minima. Pinto et al. \cite{c43} proposes to vary the field based on the distance of robot from obstacles to fill the local minima. Many researchers tried using APF as a heuristic to better guide sampling based approaches~\cite{c45, c46, c47}.

Many of the recent works focus on use of a variation of artificial potential field to plan motion of the manipulator. Xia et al.~\cite{c49} uses a variation of APF for manipulator motion~\cite{c49}. Chen et al. proposes an application using APF in joint space and a variable kinematic optimization step~\cite{c50}. Long~\cite{c44} suggests creating motion plan of the manipulator using APF, he extends it using RRT to calculate virtual attractive point for the robot to move towards in case of local minima. Zhu et al. proposes use of APF in combination with MPC, to plan in environment with dynamic obstacles~\cite{c48}.

%The inverse kinematics with task prioritisation, which is based on finding a least squares solution of the manipulator joint velocities, and linear quadratic programming (LQR) are two of the local optimization methods. Both methods are fast, suitable for real-time applications in dynamic environments and provide smooth solutions. However, since they do not plan further than one step ahead, they tend to get stuck in local minima. Therefore, they are often combined with a higher-level planner, for global static environment based \replace{motion}{path} planning, while local optimisation takes dynamic environment changes into account.

\subsection{Environment representation}

% PREDSTAVITEV PRISTOPOV RAČUNANJA ODDALJENOSTI OVIRAM
To be able to generate collision free trajectory we need to have a representation of the static environment. One common approach is to represent environment with geomertic primitives such as bounding boxes or spheres. Another way is to divide the occupied space into hierarhical trees, such as octatree, to make calculations more efficient. Such representations are memory effective and offer simple and computationally undemanding distance calculation and collision detection. These representations are widely used in computer simulations and games, however they can be suboptimal for real environment, where sensor measurements arent always accurate and contain only part of the surrounding space. This can lead to approximation errors, which are additionally probelmatic when we are dealing with irregularly shaped objects.

Point-cloud representation captures the environment by directly using a collection of points obtained from sensors like LiDAR, radar of RGBD camera, providing a more precise depiction of space than bounding boxes or spheres. This method can more accurately represent the complex and irregular shapes of real-world objects, although it typically requires more memory and computational power to process, which can make it chllenging for real-time representation. Point cloud data is often further converted into voxel grids.

Voxel grid representation divides the space into a regular grid of volumetric elements, or voxels, which can be used to create a more manageable approximation of the environment. While this approach offers a balance between detail and computational efficiency, it can still introduce discretization errors, particularly when modeling objects with smooth surfaces or intricate details. The fidelity of the representation is dependent on the size of the voxels: smaller voxels can capture more detail but require more memory and computation, while larger voxels result in coarser approximations but are more memory-efficient, adaptive voxel grids have been explored, where the voxel size can vary throughout the space to provide higher resolution in regions of interest while conserving resources in less critical areas. Voxel grids can incorporate probabilistic information, such as in occupancy grid maps, where each voxel holds a probability indicating the chance of an obstacle's presence. The occupancy probability of a voxel can be updated dynamically using sensor measurements and Bayesian updating methods. As new sensor data is collected, the probabilities are revised to reflect the increased or decreased likelihood of the presence of an obstacle in the voxel space. Additionally, techniques such as ESDF (Euclidian Signed Distance Field) and TSDF (Truncated Signed Distance Field) can be utilized in conjunction with voxel grids to encode signed distance information, that describes what is the distance between the selected voxel field and the nearest occupied field.

There has been a number of proposed algorithms for calculating ESDF. One common method is the Brushfire method, that spreads from obstacles until it calculates the distance for every field on a grid. \add{distance transforms} Jump Flooding Algorithm (JFA) is a similar method, that can be implemented on a GPU for faster parallel distance calculation.

\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if your filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named  Heading 1 ,  Heading 2 ,  Heading 3 , and  Heading 4  are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation  Fig. 1 , even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


   \begin{figure}[thpb]

      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.

      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}
   

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity  Magnetization , or  Magnetization, M , not just  M . If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write  Magnetization (A/m)  or  Magnetization {A[m(1)]} , not just  A/m . Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write  Temperature (K) , not  Temperature/K. 

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.
