function [dx,dy,dz] = interpolate_derivative(point, grid_distance, space_resolution)

    % interpolate_derivative - calculates the numerical partial derivative at a point in 3D space
    % 
    % Inputs:
    %   point - 3-element vector specifying the coordinates of the point at which the derivative is calculated
    %   grid_distance - matrix of the distance density from nearby obstacles
    %   space_resolution - scalar value specifying the distance between voxels in physical space
    %
    % Outputs:
    %   dx - partial derivative with respect to x
    %   dy - partial derivative with respect to y
    %   dz - partial derivative with respect to z
