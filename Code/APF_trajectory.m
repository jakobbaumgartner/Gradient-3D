function [outputArg1,outputArg2] = APF_trajectory(inputArg1,inputArg2)

    % calculate positions in 3D space for a number of points on a robot frame using geometric transformations

    % get APF value in every of calculated 3D points
    
    % if A - closest point only

        % find in which point APF is the highest

        % calculate Jacobian in that point

        % if there was a previously different point with highest APF calculate Jacobian in this previous point

        % calculate weighting coefficients 

        % calculate avoidance joints velocities

    
    % if B - all points on the robot

        % calculate APF in every point

        % calculate Jacobian in every point

        % calculate weighting coefficients

        % calculate avoidance joints velocities
